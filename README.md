The API offers two levels of integration. The simplest and quickest to get going is to use the high-level Launcher Tasks, with more advanced integration available to perform searches and get recommendations within your app.

## Launcher Tasks
The [launcher APIs in Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769550.aspx) allow an application to integrate with common operating system tasks such as taking a picture, finding an address or a contact, making a call, or saving a ring tone with very little effort. 

With the high-level Launchers, you can perform the following using the new app-to-app APIs that Nokia Music supports on Windows Phone 8:

- Launch the Nokia Music app
- Search for music
- Show Artist details
- Show Gigs nearby
- Show available mixes
- Show product details
- Play a mix 
 
## API Methods
With the lower-level API access, you get more control and can perform the following use cases within your app:

- Search for content
- Get top artists
- Get charts
- Get new releases
- Get a list of genres
- Get albums and tracks by an artist
- Get artist recommendations
- Get a list of available mixes
